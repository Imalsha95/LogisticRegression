# LogisticRegression
Logistic regression ML project analyzing whether the obstacle is a Rock or a mine 
Rock vs Mine Sonar Data Project
Welcome to the Rock vs Mine Sonar Data Project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model that classifies objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar signal returns. The model is implemented using logistic regression.

Overview
The goal of this project is to use sonar data to distinguish between rocks and mines. Sonar signals are used to detect objects underwater, and classifying these objects accurately is crucial for various applications, including naval and underwater exploration.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 208 samples, each with 60 features representing sonar returns at different angles. Each sample is labeled as either a rock (R) or a mine (M).

Results
The logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test set. Detailed evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, are provided in the evaluation script's output.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Please ensure your contributions adhere to the project's coding standards and include appropriate tests.
